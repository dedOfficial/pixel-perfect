# sv (Pixel Perfect Test)

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Previously

Install yarn to global dependencies if it's not exists

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
